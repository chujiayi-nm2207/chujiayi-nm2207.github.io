				Salary is actually not the key driver of satisfaction among Singaporean employees. In fact, employees who earn salaries of under $30,000 annually have rated their job satisfaction at 48%, which is just two percent lower than the highest paid employees earning $130,000 and above, <a href="https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/2-in-3-singaporeans-dread-going-to-work-daily/154231">as found by a report.</a>

				Prior to Covid-19, many employees who were dissatisfied with their jobs just chose to stay with it, in fear of having gaps in their CV and being labelled a “job hopper” if they decided to change jobs. <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/will-job-hopping-hurt-career-cv-quit-2514236#:~:text=A%20recent%20Milieu%20Insight%20survey,be%20vital%20for%20continued%20success.">(CNA,2022)</a>

				Companies are also less likely to hire those who looked like they job hop, knowing that they might soon leave for a new job again. <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/will-job-hopping-hurt-career-cv-quit-2514236#:~:text=A%20recent%20Milieu%20Insight%20survey,be%20vital%20for%20continued%20success.">(CNA,2022)</a>

			<p>
				However, companies have gradually realised that making judgements and labelling people as job hoppers are not serving anyone’s best interest. Perhaps by inquiring a little deeper into someone’s reason for job hopping, employers can learn more about potential employees and discover valuable skills and knowledge they can bring into the company. <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/will-job-hopping-hurt-career-cv-quit-2514236#:~:text=A%20recent%20Milieu%20Insight%20survey,be%20vital%20for%20continued%20success.">(CNA,2022)</a>

			In start-ups or in sectors like marketing and finance, it can be the culture to change firms, say after about two years so it is natural to link career changes to growth and exposure. Professionals have also derived that by staying too long in certain sectors, people wonder why you aren’t exposing yourself to more experiences or they may think that you can’t get a better offer anywhere else. <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/will-job-hopping-hurt-career-cv-quit-2514236#:~:text=A%20recent%20Milieu%20Insight%20survey,be%20vital%20for%20continued%20success.">(CNA,2022)</a>

				By framing and offering your career path in a way that relates to growth and exposure, you can showcase your unique skills, knowledge, competencies and experiences that employers deem valuable. Employers are also more forgiving and open to the idea of job hopping in the early stages of a career, linking it to personal discoveries of what individuals want and do not want.
